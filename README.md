# Python Projects
Welcome to my portfolio of Python Projects, here I will share my exxperience and thoughts on Python along with several projects I worked on either as part of a class or just to explore the capablities of the language.

## Introduction:

What is Python? Well it's a general purpoose programming language. It's very popular with beginners and has a ton of users which means there is basically a tutorial or blog post about anything you could possibly do. That is a major advantage along with Google's adoption of Python early on.

"Sounds cool, but how do I get it?"

Well if you have a Mac like I do you already have it! But it's in your terminal and tricky to use, so instead moost people rely on IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) which makes things so much easier and it handles all the installations and stuff in one place.

I use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) which in my opinion just slaps. Here is a [clear and easy guide from UW-Madison](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/cs564-s18/material/jupyter_install.html).

## Wonderful World of Packages or Modules:

With the basic version of Python you can do arithmetic, loops, if/else statements, and so on. To do some very complicated things you are going to packages, which are basically tricks and shortcuts developed by very knowledgable and neatly organized into a single neat package.

Some of the most useful and well known ones are:

1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib
4) Seaborn
5) Scikit-Learn

Those are packages I will be using mostly in my projects.

# The Lead:

The reason you're here hopefully, below are the links to each topic of my projects. I will be showing how I apply each method to a unique problem.
