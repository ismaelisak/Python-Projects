# Linear Regression:

What is it? Well in the simplest sense it's the study of the slope, aka rate of change. We can gain many insights from it about our data and where it is generally trending. I don't want to get bogged down in the details of it and the in-depth statistical discussion involved (I REALLY WANT TO).

You've seen $y = mx + b$ before where $m$ is the slope, $b$ is the intercept, and $x$ is the independent variable aka our data points. The goal is to create an equation $y$ that we can use to predict $x$.

## The Problem:

Finding linear patterns in the AmesHousing dataset.

## Dataset:
